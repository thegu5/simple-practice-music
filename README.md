# simple-practice-music

It's a practice music hack for geometry dash, but as a dll! No config, no external program, no nothing. Pretty much just meant for quickldr.

(This might not compile with windows now idk, go to mat's repo for an unedited `CMakeLists.txt`)

Thanks to mat for [the template](https://github.com/matcool/gd-mod-example)
